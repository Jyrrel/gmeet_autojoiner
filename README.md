# Additional Info

- **IMPORTANT**: The the webcam is enabled by default,  so if you plan to run this on your laptop, be sure to cover your webcam. One way to do this is to configure the laptop to not go into "sleep" mode  when the lid is closed. 

- If you host this locally, make sure that you laptop/PC doesn't sleep, or else this is not going to work.

- The email, password, and meeting details are held in a variable. This means that whenever you restart the server, these variables are reset. So make sure to enter everything again if you restart the server. 

- By default, a chrome window is opened when joining a meeting. If you dont want the chrome window to open, go into app.js and change `HEADLESS=false` to `HEADLESS=true`

- The process checks every few seconds to join a valid meeting. This is controlled by the `CHECKTIME` variable which is set to 10 seconds by default. Change that  variabel to change how often the procces checks for meetings to join.

# Error resolving

Please use this at your own risk. I do not guaranty that this will work 100% of time. If you choose to use this, know that there are chances of you not joining the meeting successfully and loosing your attendance.
